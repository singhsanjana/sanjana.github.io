					<highlight>Automated Bug Detection and Repair in C11 Programs: Insights and Experiences</highlight> (<i>under peer review</i>)
                    <br>The C/C++ 2011 standard, which introduced the C11 weak memory model, offers syntactic constructs to specify a range of ordering guarantees for development of efficient weak memory concurrent programs. However, the complexity of the model poses challenges and can lead to programming bugs. To fully leverage the potential of the C11 model, robust development support is crucial. 
					<br>In this study, we investigate the existing development support for C11 programs, focusing specifically on bug detection and automated repair. We propose a novel set of stress tests for C11 generated by utilizing automated repair techniques. We explore various bug detection techniques for C11 and assess their performance on these novel stress tests. Through our investigation, we uncover both strengths and weaknesses that were previously unreported. Additionally, we identify weaknesses in the existing automated code repair techniques. These weaknesses not only impact their performance but also hinder the generation of effective stress tests. Therefore, building upon our investigative findings, we propose improvements to enhance the automated repair capabilities under C11.
                    
					<p><highlight>Optimal Stateless Model Checking based on a Coarse Trace Equivalence</highlight> (<i>under peer review</i>)
                    <br>Partitioning program executions into equivalence classes is central to efficient stateless model checking of concurrent programs. An equivalence relation drives the partitioning, and prior works have investigated various such relations toward minimizing the set of equivalence classes. This work introduces a novel view-equivalence partitioning relation that relies on the values read by memory accesses. Two program executions are view-equivalent if (i) they have the same set of read memory accesses and (ii) the read memory accesses read the same values. For any input program, view-equivalence is at least as coarse as any existing equivalence relation and, thus, induces the least number of equivalence classes. This work also proposes a stateless model checker based on view-equivalence, called ViEqui, that is sound, complete, and optimal under view-equivalence. ViEqui is implemented for C/C++ input programs over the Nidhugg tool. We test its correctness over 16000+ litmus tests and compare its performance against prior stateless model checkers on challenging benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that ViEqui performs over 20x faster in ∼18% of tests and times out in significantly lesser tests than other existing techniques.</p>

					<p><highlight>Lock-aware Optimal Stateless Model Checking based on a Coarse Trace Equivalence</highlight>
					<br>Coarse-grained synchronization mechanisms such as locks are the most popular techniques for providing synchronization in concurrent programs. The coarse-grained locks introduce lock acquisition events whose interleaving order may determine which thread acquires the lock-object and accordingly which events are enabled. Thus, various orders of interleaving of lock acquisition events may lead to different equivalence classes. Since equivalence classes are not known to SMCs a-priori, they must explore various possible orders of lock acquisitions for completeness. This work extends the ViEqui technique by considering lock acquisition and unlock or release lock events, along with read and write events, and performs analysis observing consistent coarse-grained synchronization. As an optimization against considering all feasible lock acquisition orders, \laviequi technique pivots on recognizing the feasibility of the reads-from relation. Essentially, the technique seeks an order of lock acquisitions that permit the required reads-from relation.</p>

		Created a prototype tool for a bug localization technique that is based on the hypothesis that a mutant of the source code could be a better approximation of the intended code. The work involved proposal of mutation operators to create mutants to detect buggy lines of code. And testing of proposed mutants for usefulness towards the hypothesis.

		<highlight>B.Tech. Project<br>Mining mailing list for extracting useful information<br></highlight>
		Created a query response system that mines developer mailing lists for extracting useful information and possible response to the query and finally producing the best fit match for a user’s query. Used concepts like caching (of frequent responses), stopword elimination and stemming (for refining query), topic modeling (to classify mails in mailer list), sentiment analysis (to marks mails as positive or negative) and ranking mechanism (for ranking the responses).
